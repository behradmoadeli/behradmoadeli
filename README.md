My Name is Behrad 'Brad' Moadeli. I am currently a PhD candidate at the University of Alberta. I'm majoring in Chemical Engineering Process Control.

I am currently working on my first paper. I intend to use Github to have some sort of version control over my project, as well as sharing them with my team!
